//starting in a leadership role at a new place is particularly challenging. 
As a leader you have impact on the lives of the terammembers. They are assessing you more than you are assessing them.
People want a leader, and while you get the manager title from a get go, establishing onself as a leader in the team takes time, and effort.

#The big picture 
Understand fully what your company does for a living. Be ready to give a thirty-second overview to anyone who asks, from your friends to your grandma to your next-door neighbor.
Understand your role in contributing to the bottom line of the company. Keep your eyes (and your career) focused on the big picture rather than on your own little cube.

//presonal relevance - this is the first time that I was hired as an external leader
Before I was promoted and had a chance to know the team, the company and grow into the new position. Not this time.
I'm overwhelemed and want to make things right and be as prepared as one can be. I picked up The FIrst 90 days.

//The importance of securing early wins. How can you begin adding value fast?

1. Understand the goals of the company and how you, as a leader of your unit, can fit into this strategy.
- review past executive vison decks to understand strategy, current and past
- understand overall company metrics, how company measures progress against the goals + how do you mesure performance of technology on your team
- understand the financials: annual report
- understand product: review product roadmap
- understand market and competition: competitive analysis doc
- customers: how they are treated, how long is the fedback loop
- company culture: do people live the values or do they behave orthogonally to what is posted on the posters. current culture on the team vs. what yo uwnat it to be


understand the past: past strategy, routes not takes, product features that were realesed and well received, and those that flopped

The first few weeks establish the strategy to make progress towards all these objectives.
Month 2 - 
Month 3 -

By the end of 3 month you should begin add value.

Listen and Observe. Make mental notes on inefficiences and potential areas of improvement, though don't rush with suggestions yet. Hold on for at lease a month. After you have had a chance to immerce yoursf into the company's culture you have a higher chance to execute within the company's norm and have your ideas take off and not land flat.

- how ideas are presented? democracy or dictatorship?
- what is the meeting culture?
- what happens when things go wrong? team level and company level?
- how new employees are on-boarded?

Attend every meeting you can, immerse yourself into how the company operates currently.
#Do your homework
Competitive analysis, company products, etc. This will allow to ask more grounded questions to begin with.

#Meeting your boss
In the first day or two meet to understand the expectations for your role, setup a rhythm for communication, and to also provide your plan of action.
- How do you prefer to communicate - email or in person? How often would you like me to give you updates and progress reports?
- What types of decisions can I make autonomously, and what would you like to be consulted on for approval ahead of time?

#Meet your peers
If you're inhereting a team, current manager of this team.
Questions:
- Dos and don'ts for working with our manager
- Current challenges of the team you're inhereting
- What one thing should I know about [manager] above all else? What makes him/her tick?‚Äù

#Meeting your team
At certain point you will be introduced to the team. This is an impactful moment. Prepare! Come up with a story about yourself. 3-4 lines, but communicate the following: I'm not dangerous, I'm on your side, I'm competent and I respect you. 

1-on-1 with every member of the team during your first week. Prepare a good list of questions ahead of time. Don't speak too much about yourself. Satistfy their curiosity and be polite, but understand that the purpose of this meeting is for you to learn. Here's my list of questions:
- Be personable
- http://katemats.com/conversations-with-your-team-peers-and-boss-guide-for-new-leaders/
- Thank them, it's not an interrogation

Pitfalls:
- making promises, or, conversely, admitting that making change is not within your power
- confessing

Make notes! Not on the meeting of course, but be sure to make notes - in the future to discover patterns and analyze further.
