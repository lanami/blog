=== Don't ===
# Use plain text template without clear indication of sections. I scan your resume for about 15 seconds, and will not waste time trying to figure out who you are and what you do
- What are your key skills
- How long have you been doing this
- What are your experience
# Get creative with links. Github://<username> - oh, I'm not going to type that in.
# Put common sense things in the Skills section
Nobody puts MS Word, Excel and Powerpoint proficiency on their resume any more - it's a given. For a softare engineer such givens are Linux commandline, Git. Your IDE of preference doesn't matter. Familiarity with Agile and experience working a a part of a Scrum team is implied. Jira. What I care about is your primary stack: Java / .Net / Mean / Mobile
# Describe what your application / project does.
# If you're more than 3 years past graduation, don't include your GPA and (ir)relevant coursework
# Include technologies you know nothing about. Application/Web Servers: Tomcat, JBOSS, Splunk, Tableau. is an automatic pass
# Refer to yourself in third person, it's wierd

=== Do ===
Skip operating systems unless you apply for a sys admin or devops job that requires intimate understanding of the innerworkings of certain OSs
# Provide clear clickavle links to your profiles on LinkedIn, Githubm and personal site
# Get a professional email address, pinkbeard88@yahoo.com
# If you are appying for a position in a different city, include a cover letter indicating your desire to relocate.
# If your last position is abroad, include a cover letter and indicate your visa status / need for visa sponsorship, and desire to relocate
# If you're not currently employed, include a note explaining it in your cover letter
# Descrive your contribution to the project.
# Include you continuing education activities (Coursera, certifications)
# Specialize. When I see some front-end, some tech support, some mobile work in a resume application for a backend engineer position, I pass 

=== General notes ===
It's great that you have hobbies. But if your extra curriculars take up too much of your resume, I don't think you're committed and passioante about software engineering and will likely... pass.
